Description: Often times I face the difficulty of not being able to save all my 
results from my R console to a file to refer back to it later. However, with my 
new package it will be able to save all the results after running the R script 
into a file and will be able to update the result for each line of code that is 
ran incase you want to edit it and rerun it. 
Depends: R (>= 2022.12.0+353)
